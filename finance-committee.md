## Role Description

For Finance, the primary responsibility is to establish the budget prior to the conference and keep folks on track to pull off a great conference day-of while leaving enough to get things started again next year.

There is a secondary responsibility which lies with all organizers and volunteers, to keep the entire team updated with a clear understanding of what has been committed to, what has been spent, what reimbursement is needed, and any other information which would affect the financial status of the conference.
